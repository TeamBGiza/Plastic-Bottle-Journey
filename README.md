# Project Overview
The Plastic Bottle Journey project aims to illustrate the life cycle of a plastic bottle—from its use and disposal, through waterways into the sea, its harmful effects on marine life, and eventually its impact on humans.
The video will conclude with a positive call to action encouraging viewers to Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.
The project will be created using motion graphics software (After Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop) supported by a storyboard and bilingual (Arabic & English) VoiceOver script.
